# UCT-Micromouse
Background
This repository contains the work for the Micromouse Project in the EEE3088F course for 2024. The goal is to design and build two critical subsystems for a maze-solving robot called a micromouse: the power module and the sensing module.

The power module is responsible for powering the robot's motors, charging the battery, and managing power efficiently. It ensures the micromouse has the energy it needs to navigate the maze.

The sensing module acts as the "eyes" of the micromouse, detecting obstacles, walls, and potential paths through the maze using sensors. Without accurate sensing, the robot would be unable to map and solve the maze effectively.

The main challenge of the project will be to adhere to a strict budget.
