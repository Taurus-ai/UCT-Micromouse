# UCT-Micromouse EEE3088F PROJECT 2024 - POWER SUBMODULE
This is a repository for the power subsystem. The power substem is responsible for providing power to the micromouse design.
This design has 4 subcircuits which make up the subsytem:
1. Connectors - These provide interface to the other submodules. 
2. USB Power Supply - This provides external power to the circuit to charge the battery.
3. Battery charger - This cicuit mornitors the battery and charge it.
4. Motor Driver - This is a dual H-bridge motor driver circuit which drives 2 motors at desired current. 

This reporsitory includes the following files:
1. KiCAd project - This has the design of the pcb
2. BOM file - Bill of matertials for the components in the design
3. Datasheets - These are datasheets of the components used in the design.
