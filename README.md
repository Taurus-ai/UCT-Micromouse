# UCT-Micromouse EEE3088F PROJECT 2024 - POWER SUBMODULE
This is a repository for the power subsystem. The power substem is responsible for providing power to the micromouse design.
This design has 4 subcircuits which make up the subsytem:
1. Connectors - These provide interface to the other submodules. 
2. USB Power Supply - This provides external power to the circuit to charge the battery.
3. Battery charger - This cicuit mornitors the battery and charge it.
